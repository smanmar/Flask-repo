# Building a website using flask framework.

I'm going to create a website with Python, covering Flask, authentication, databases,
and more. The goal of this project is to give clients what they need to make a finished product that so that they can tweak,
and turn into anything I like. I'm going to also go over how you create a new user's account,
how to store those in a database, how to log into those user accounts, how to log out of them, 
and how you associate that information with a specific user!
